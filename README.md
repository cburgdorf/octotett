[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/cburgdorf/octotett.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cburgdorf/octotett)

It's a Top Trumps game based on github projects

You can play the game at: http://hannoverjs.github.com/game-off-2012/

The game is built up on two frameworks

1.) quartettjs: https://github.com/cburgdorf/quartettjs

It's a UI agnostic game engine for Quartett (Top Trumps) games.
It was written for the purpose of this game.

2.) Sencha Touch

This actually implies that this game was written for tablets and
smartphones. It will work on desktop Chrome, too. But it
probably won't work on Firefox for example
